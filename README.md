# tawawa_filter
Simple "Tawawa filter" implemented in Python. This turns grayscale manga panels into blueish manga panels.

You can either run it without any arguments, which will look for images at ./inputs, or pass the directory you want with --path. The script will run for all PNG files inside the directory, if you need it to work with JPGs, simply replace "\*.png" with "\*.jpg".

Example:

![Tawawa Filter example](./example.png "Tawawa Filter example")
